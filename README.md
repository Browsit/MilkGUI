  <h1>Cerealize Bukkit inventories</h1>
  <h3>MilkGUI is a tasty way to create inventories for player consumption. Each item is sugar-coded to accept a unique name, amount, durability (for older versions of Minecraft) and lore. The resulting files are easy to understand without having to spoonfeed administrators.</h3>
